Rules of the repo; ensure you pull before you push. This is to ensure you have pulled the recent changes to your local machine.

Also, ensure you work on your branch DO NOT WORK OR COMMIT YOUR CODES TO THE MASTER/MAIN BRANCH

To create a branch git checkout -b my-branch-name DON'T FORGET NO SPACE. YOU CAN USE CAMEL CASING

Afetr that follow the ffg commands; git add . git commit -m "your-commit-message" git push -u origin my-branch-name

Then go to github, refresh and you'll see a green button at the top to create a pull request.

Use git status to know if your working tree is clean and if there's no uncommitted changes.
